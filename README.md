# PoolCleaningHelper
An almost fully client side app that helps pool cleaners and pool owners find the size of their pool in gallons and know how many chemicals to add in their pool

Note that this is not the intended use of Next.js OR (to some extent), react. Reason for this all being built in Next is because it's a very small piece of a very big project of mine.
